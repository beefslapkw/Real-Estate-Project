# Real-Estate-Project

In today’s digital age, having an accessible and well-structured real-estate website is
essential for potential home buyers. A real-estate website serves as a platform for connection
between owners, real-estate agents, and clients to ensure a smooth process of transaction. With
the increase of usage of online platforms, real-estate companies must ensure that their websites
are functional, simple, and easy to navigate to improve user experience and engagement.

Some real-estate companies still have outdated and poorly designed websites that do not
fully fulfill the necessary qualities like clear navigation, proper structuring of content, and even
the aesthetic properties of the website itself, making it difficult for customers to maintain
engagement with the website. According to an article written by Spilka (2024), 72% of
customers lose interest in a business due to bad website design. If a business’ website is badly
designed, it may lose potential customers, money, increase bounce rates, and decrease
conversion rates.

Developing a real-estate website that is well-structured and user-friendly is important in

addressing the mentioned issues. A well-organized website improves accessibility, user-
engagement, proper delivery of information, and improves the experience for owners, real-estate

agents, and clients. With the help of a well-designed website, imparting important details while
retaining user engagement will be made possible. Using a lightweight and efficient framework
like W3.CSS makes it possible for a responsive design that works across various devices like
personal computers and phones, ensuring that the website will be fully accessible for all users
(Foong, 2019).

The primary objective of this project is to create a fully functional real-estate website
using only HTML and CSS with the W3.CSS framework. The website includes key features such
as a homepage introducing the real-estate company, an about us page that outlines the company’s
purpose and available types of properties, a contact us page that lists the company’s contact
numbers, email address, location, messaging area, and also a subscription segment for a mailings
list, and a find a property page that details the available properties. By focusing on these
elements, the project seeks to create an informative, aesthetically pleasing, and accessible
platform for owners, real-estate agents, and potential home buyers.

In conclusion, this project presents a simple but effective approach to real-estate website
development that addresses the problem of outdated and poorly designed websites. By using
HTML, CSS, and W3.CSS framework, the website offers a responsive and user-friendly
platform that ensures improvement of user experience in accessing information and website
navigation.
